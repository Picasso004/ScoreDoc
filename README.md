# ScoreDoc

ScoreDoc is a web application designed to find the most relevants documents in a set of documents based on some keywords.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your local machine:

1. Git
2. Python

## Cloning the Project

To clone the ScoreDoc project from GitLab, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt on your local machine.

2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. For example:

   ```
   cd /path/to/your/directory
   ```

3. Run the following command to clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://gitlab.com/Picasso004/scoredoc.git
   ```

4. After the repository has been cloned, navigate to the project folder:

   ```
   cd scoredoc
   ```

5. Install the required Python packages using pip:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Application

1. Execute the `run.py` script to start the Flask application:

   ```
   python run.py
   ```

2. The application should now start, and a web page should open in your default web browser pointing to the Flask application's address (e.g., `http://localhost:6969/finder`).


## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
